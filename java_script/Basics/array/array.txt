Array Methods:
==============

1.length(): it is used to find the length of the array.
2.push(element1,element2,...,elementN): it is used to add the element at the end of the array.
3.pop(): it is used to remove the last element from the array.
4.unshift(element1,element2,...,elementN): it is used to add the element at the beginning of the array.
5.shift(): it is used to remove the first element from the array.
6.indexOf(element,start_index): it is used to find the index of the given element in the array.
note: pop and shift no arguments method
7.slice(start_index,end_index):it is used to fetch a part of the array.it will not effect the original array.
   --> end_index will be excluded.
8.splice(start_index,number_of_elements_to_remove,element1,element2,...): it is used to add or remove the elements from the array.
 here we will pass the start_index value,then we will pass the number of elements to be removed and then we will pass the elements to be added.
 this method will effect the original array.
9.concat(array1,array2,...,arrayN): it is used to merge 2 or morethan 2 arrays.it will not effect the original array.
10.map():it is used to iterate over each and evry method prasent in an array
   -->it will return new array based on the operation perform.
11.filter():this method is used to filter the given array based on the condition
        --> evry time it will retun new array/filterd array
12.reduce():this method is used to reduce all the elements prasent in the array to an single value.
13.some():this method will iterate over the element prasent in the array and if any one element satisfies the condition it will true otherwise False
14.Every(): this method will iterate over the evry element prasent in an array and if alla elements satisfies the condition,then only
return true otherwise False
15.includes(): this method will iterate over the evry element prasent in an string and if all elements satisfies the condition,then only
return true otherwise False

16.find():this method will iterate over the evry element prasent in the array and the first element which will satisfies the condition it will return 

17.fill():it is used to fill a new element in place of the old element

18.flat():this method is used to merge nested array with the parent one

19.toString():to conver in to astring it will not effect original array

20.revers(): this method will revers the orderof elements prasent in the array . thos will effect the original array

21.from(): this method is used to convert string , html collection,node list in to array
