why TypeScript:
==============

A project size increases, it becomes hard to maintain
the JavaScript code as it is a loosely typed language

typeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around 
within the code.
the ability report errors when the types don't match

1.npm init
2.npm install typescript
3.npx tsc (check version)
4.tsc --init (Created a new tsconfig.json  )
5.tsc hello.ts

8.npx ts-node hello.ts
